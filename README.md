# SOLID-Principle
Solid Principle Study

My conclude of SOLID Principle, it's a pratice or pattern for us to design a system or project, we should try to obey the principle, it's will save our time to design a system, for beginner it will be a bit tricky to follow, but once the beginner is master or understond the concept will contribute well in a project that design based on SOLID principle. It's good to had, but unnecessary.
